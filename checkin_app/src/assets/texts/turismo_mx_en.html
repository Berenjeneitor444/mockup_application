    <b>NOTICE: DRUGS ARE PROHIBITED IN MEXICO</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      The possession, purchase, or use of drugs are illegal in Mexico. Do not be
      misled into believing that, because you are visiting, this is allowed or
      tolerated. It is strictly prohibited and will result in legal action by
      local police authorities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Do not put yourself at risk. Drug dealers at beaches and nightclubs will
      get you into trouble with the law -- they are not your friends, but
      criminals. Avoid interacting with anyone selling to you in public places,
      including unlicensed vendors on the beach.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Enjoy a drug-free vacation to be a part of the solution.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This notice is to provide all visitors to the destination with the
      necessary information to be alert and make the right choices.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I confirm that I have read the above notice and understand the legal
      consequences of buying illegal substances in Mexico.
